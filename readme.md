# Chat Application with PDF Processing Capabilities

## Introduction

This project is a chat application integrated with PDF processing capabilities. It allows users to upload PDF files, extract text from them, and engage in a chat-based question-answering system using the extracted content. The application also features user authentication and conversation history tracking.

## Technology Stack

The project utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Streamlit**: Used for building the user interface and integrating various components.
- **PyPDF2**: Enables the extraction of text from PDF files.
- **Firebase**: Provides the backend infrastructure for user authentication and data storage.
- **LangChain**: Utilized for text processing, including text splitting, vector storage, and question-answering capabilities.
- **HuggingFace**: Integrated for natural language processing and embeddings.
- **Cryptography**: Utilized for data encryption and security.
- **Markdown**: Used for creating README files and formatting text for the web.

The application leverages these technologies to create a seamless user experience for PDF processing, chat interactions, and user management.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Users can upload PDF files, which are then processed to extract text.
- **Chat-based Q&A**: The extracted content from the PDFs can be queried through a chat interface.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration using Firebase.
